## [Unreleased]

## [v0.0.1] - 2026-05-29

Initial public release. A self-contained iTunes-style music manager that imports / edits / plays / exports your library, rips CDs with MusicBrainz lookup, and builds playlists declaratively from a YAML rules file.

### Library I/O
- Import and export iTunes `Library.xml` (Apple plist format) — interoperable with rekordbox / Serato / Traktor.
- Add audio files (FLAC / MP3 / M4A / WAV / Ogg / Opus / AIFF) by drag-pick; tags are read with `lofty`.
- SQLite (WAL) backing store with indices for fast search and big libraries (10,000+ tracks tested).

### CD ripping
- Detect TOC + MusicBrainz disc-id via libdiscid (Linux / macOS).
- Look the disc up on MusicBrainz; pick a release candidate (with Cover Art Archive preview).
- Rip with cdparanoia → encode to FLAC / ALAC / MP3 320 / WAV via flac / ffmpeg / lame.
- Live per-track progress; ripped files are auto-added to the library.

### Library views
- All Tracks (virtualized, 10k+ rows smooth).
- Albums view: card grid grouped by `album + albumArtist`, ▶ Play Album, inline tracklist on expand.
- Artists view: same but grouped by artist, with Album column.
- Recently Played view.
- Playlist tree with folder hierarchy.

### Track editing
- Sortable columns (12 columns including Album Artist, Year, Date Added) with persistent ▲ / ▼.
- Column picker (⚙︎ icon) with `localStorage`-persisted visibility.
- Inline ★ rating; click to set 1–5 / 0.
- Genre column shows space-separated tags as clickable chips; chip click drops the tag into the search bar.
- Get Info / Cmd+I dialog: edit every track metadata field.
- Bulk genre tag add / remove via the row context menu.

### Playback
- ⏮ ⏯ ⏹ ⏭ + 🔀 shuffle + 🔁 / 🔂 repeat (off / all / one) + 🔊 volume.
- Playback queue with auto-advance (500 ms polling).
- Windows SMTC integration: Now Playing widget + media keys (Play / Pause / Toggle / Next / Prev / Stop).
- Local file playback via rodio + symphonia (FLAC / MP3 / AAC / Vorbis / WAV / etc.).

### Declarative playlists
- YAML rules: per-playlist conditions (`all` / `any` / `not` + field operators + `inPlaylist` references).
- Generators: `bpmRange`, `ranges`, `tags`; reusable `templates`; namespace + folder hierarchy.
- In-app CodeMirror YAML editor with Validate / Preview (tree + counts) / Apply.
- Apply writes generated folders and playlists into the SQLite store so they show up in the sidebar and export with the next `Library.xml`.

### Updates
- Update banner on app launch if a newer GitHub Release is published.
- Close-time dialog: "閉じる前にアップデート？" — first close intercept opens the release page or "Later".
